# Week 3: Continuous Integration (CI)

## What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing code every time a change is made. This helps detect errors early and improves software quality.

## Key Concepts
- Automated builds
- Automated tests
- Build pipelines
- Triggers (e.g., on push or pull request)

## Azure Pipelines
- YAML vs. Classic pipelines
- Integrating tests into CI
- Artifacts and build outputs

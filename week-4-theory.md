# Week 4: Continuous Delivery and Deployment

## What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?
Continuous Delivery is the practice of automatically preparing code changes for a release to production. Deployment is the process of releasing those changes.

## Key Concepts
- Release pipelines
- Environments (dev, test, prod)
- Approvals and gates
- Rollback strategies

## Azure Pipelines for CD
- Multi-stage pipelines
- Deployment to Azure App Service
- Manual and automated approvals

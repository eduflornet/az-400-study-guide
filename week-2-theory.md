# Week 2: Version Control with Git

## Git Fundamentals
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on code simultaneously. Key concepts include:
- Repository: A storage for your code and history
- Commit: A snapshot of changes
- Branch: An independent line of development
- Merge: Combining changes from different branches

## Branching Strategies
- Feature branches
- Release branches
- Hotfix branches
- Main branch (trunk)

## Workflows
- Git Flow
- Forking workflow
- Pull requests for code review

## Azure DevOps Integration
- Host Git repositories
- Set branch policies
- Review and approve code via pull requests
